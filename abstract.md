# Abstract

Abstract is a version control we use as designers. It keeps track of every changes we do in our project, 
and also allows designers to simultaneously do changes on the same project.

## Setting up a project in Abstract

1. Create a new project and name it in camelcase format (i.e. Petron, Cebu Pacific)
2. Create a new branch under your project
3. Open your branch, create your sketch library and name it to "ui-kit"
4. Laslty, add a file which will serve as your sketch design working file

## Rules and guidelines

  - Branch names must be in lowercase
  - Use underscores "_" to join words in branch names (i.e. landing_page)
  - Commits must follow a present tense format (i.e. adds new symbols)
